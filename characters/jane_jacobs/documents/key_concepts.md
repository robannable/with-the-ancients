# Jane Jacobs: Key Urban Planning Concepts

## The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961)

Jane Jacobs' seminal work challenged the prevailing urban planning orthodoxy of her time, including both the City Beautiful movement and modernist planning theories.

### Four Generators of Diversity

Jacobs identified four conditions necessary for vibrant urban neighborhoods:

1. **Mixed Primary Uses**
   - Districts must serve more than one primary function
   - Different uses bring people to the same place at different times
   - This ensures continuous activity and "eyes on the street"

2. **Short Blocks**
   - Frequent opportunities to turn corners
   - Creates more routes through the neighborhood
   - Increases chance encounters and economic opportunities

3. **Buildings of Varied Age and Condition**
   - Mix of old and new buildings
   - Old buildings provide affordable spaces for new enterprises
   - Economic diversity depends on physical diversity

4. **Sufficient Density**
   - Enough people to support diverse uses
   - Concentration creates vitality and economic viability
   - But must be balanced with quality of life

### Eyes on the Street

Natural surveillance through active street life:
- Shopkeepers, residents, pedestrians provide constant informal watching
- Safety comes from activity and presence, not emptiness
- Contrast to modernist "towers in the park" approach

### The Street Ballet

Jacobs' metaphor for the intricate choreography of urban life:
- Organized complexity of city neighborhoods
- Self-regulating systems that emerge from many individual actions
- Cannot be designed from above, only nurtured

## Critique of Urban Renewal

Jacobs was a fierce opponent of 1950s-60s urban renewal:

### The "Cataclysmic Money" Problem
- Large influxes of money for wholesale demolition
- Destroys working neighborhoods labeled as "slums"
- Replaces vibrant diversity with monotonous projects

### Robert Moses and the Expressway Wars
- Fought Moses' plan for Lower Manhattan Expressway
- Organized community resistance in Greenwich Village
- Victory showed communities could challenge planning elites

### Towers in the Park
- Critique of Le Corbusier's Radiant City vision
- Isolated high-rises in empty plazas destroy street life
- Concentration without vitality

## Border Vacuums and Dead Zones

Certain urban elements kill city life:
- Wide highways that separate neighborhoods
- Large parking lots
- Single-use megaprojects
- Anything that interrupts street activity and creates barriers

## The Importance of "Unslumming"

Neighborhoods can improve gradually from within:
- Self-diversification over time
- Mix of old and new
- Variety of prices and uses
- Contrast to wholesale clearance and rebuilding

## Economic Development Principles

### Cities as Primary Economic Engines
- Cities are where innovation happens
- Import replacement creates economic growth
- Diversity of enterprises crucial for resilience

### Small Businesses and Economic Ecology
- Old buildings nurture new enterprises
- Variety of rents allows variety of businesses
- Economic monocultures are fragile

## Community Participation

Jacobs championed grassroots organizing:
- Local knowledge trumps expert planning
- Communities understand their neighborhoods better than outsiders
- Successful organizing in West Village and other neighborhoods
- Model for community-led planning

## Living Systems Perspective

Cities as organized complexity:
- Not machines to be designed
- Not random disorder
- Complex adaptive systems with emergent properties
- Must be understood through observation, not abstract theory

## Key Observations from Real Cities

### Hudson Street (Her Own Neighborhood)
- Detailed observations of daily life
- How diverse uses create continuous activity
- Role of "public characters" - shopkeepers, regular users

### Boston's North End
- Labeled a "slum" by planners but actually vital
- Low crime, strong community
- Success invisible to metrics planners used

### Failed Projects
- Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis - demolished after becoming unlivable
- Many urban renewal projects that destroyed more than they created
- Lessons in what kills urban vitality

## Later Works

### The Economy of Cities (1969)
Cities as engines of economic innovation

### Cities and the Wealth of Nations (1984)
City-regions as fundamental economic units

### The Nature of Economies (2000)
Ecological principles applied to economics

### Dark Age Ahead (2004)
Warning about cultural amnesia and loss of effective institutions

## Lasting Influence

Jacobs' ideas influenced:
- New Urbanist movement
- Community-based planning
- Historic preservation movements
- Opposition to urban freeways
- Mixed-use zoning reform
- Recognition of informal social capital in neighborhoods

Her work remains a touchstone for anyone questioning top-down planning and advocating for community-centered approaches to cities.
